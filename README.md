# Numerical-methods
This repository implements some numerical methods commonly used in scientific computing, focusing on:

*  Cholesky decomposition: Efficiently solves positive definite systems of linear equations.
* Lagrange interpolation: Approximates functions using their values at specified points.
* Derivative estimation: Calculates numerical derivatives using central and forward difference methods.
  
**Repository Contents:**

* cholesky.py: Implements the Cholesky decomposition algorithm.
* LagrangeInterplotion.py: Implements the Lagrange interpolation method.
* derivative.py: Implements central and forward difference methods for derivative estimation.
